# Community Detection using Spreading Process

An SIR-like (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model is used to find the spread of a disease in a network.
This is further used to calculate distance between two nodes and the similarity between them.
The nodes are then clustered into communities.

It has been implemented on the famous "Football Network" with 114 nodes. It is anetwork of American football games between Division IA colleges during regular season Fall 2000.
